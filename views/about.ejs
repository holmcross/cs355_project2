<h1>The Triangular Department - We're Adjacent To You!</h1>
<h2>What We Do</h2>
<p>Nanaette Nunanchi had a vision. That vision was to get 45 piglets in a bundle and send them off to charity.
    This never quuite worked out as George couldn't be bothered to give a hand, so we decided to enter into an emerging market and sell music albums instead!
At the Triangular Department, you can browse our extensive catalog 6 (or 7?) albums, arbitrarily chosen from what was on our creators mind at the time of this website's creation.
You can also expect all of your personal information to be stored in plaintext, so any wannabe hacker who read a blog entry about
kali linux can easily gain access to it all!</p>

<h3>Not enough to the point? Alright...</h3>
<p>CUSTOMERS: You can browse a list of albums for sale. We also accept custom order requests. A customer must
first have an account on file before you can successfully place an order of any kind.</p>
<p>EMPLOYEES: You can check a list of customer orders that need attention (selected from a VIEW). These can be order
that require payment, custom orders that we need to get in touch with the customer and let them know if they're possible, or pull
up a list of all of our media formats for which there is at least 1 of them in stock (using a aggregate function and Having clause. Neat!). Employees can also see which albums are present in more then one order, using a subquery!</p>
